# Color a map with minimum colors


                    PROJECT  8   GRAPH Application AND BREADTH FIRST SEARCH TREE
In graph theory, breadth-first search (BFS) is a strategy for searching in a graph when search is limited to essentially two operations: 
1.	Visit and inspect a node of a graph; 
2.	Gain access to visit the nodes that neighbor to the currently visited node. 
The BFS begins at a root node and inspects all the neighboring nodes. Then for each of those neighbor nodes in turn, it inspects their neighbor nodes which were unvisited, and so on. (Nodes are also called vertices; Path connecting two nodes are also called edges.)
a)	Using the graph algorithm discussed in the class, implement a program in any language you desire to do Map Coloring Problem for the attached map of South America:
    (You may use different map with minimum of 12 vertices.)
(1)	The neighboring countries must use different colors.
(2)	Convert the map coloring problem to a graph diagram from the attached map of South America. 
(Draw the graph diagram. You may use pen/pencil to draw this in a very nice drawing if utility software is not available.)
(3)	Display the adjacency list representation of the graph from (a.2)
(4)	Convert the graph or its list representation to a BFS tree. Display the tree
in any format  you prefer.
(5)	Display the color used for each country and the colors for all countries.
(Find an algorithm to use the minimum number of colors.)
(6)	The colors used should be in the following order:
{Blue, Brown, Green, Lavender, Orange, Pink, Red, Yellow, Violet, Gold,  
Gray, Indigo, Silver}
b)	Also turn in the actual map with colors by using either color crayons or being colored by software. The color of each country must match the result of (a.4).
c)	Do whatever you want if not specified in the project.
